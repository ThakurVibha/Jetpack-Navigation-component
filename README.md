# Jetpack-Navigation-component

Demo app to implement the functionality of Android Jetpack's Navigation component ðŸ™„ðŸ¥±to navigate and pass data between different fragments with ease and a little pinch of animations.

This is what I have learned:-
* Navigation from one fragment to another fragment using navgraph and NavController.
* Passing data between fragments using Gradle plugin Safe Args.
* How to add Animations for smooth navigation.
